The etchsketch program is ready to go. The screen now displays on the 8x8 matrix
To run that program, type  python3 etchsketch.py 
 to get the screen to display and buttons to play with.


The temperature sensor reads correctly with the temperature. I showed both the temperature and matrix demos to Dr. Yoder. We couldn't figure out why the alert didn't work even when we set the bits on the device.


Now, I have upgraded the system to use callbacks. HTOP shows it running smoothly at 3% compared to full load before. Also, I combined the temperature reading with the matrix. Now, when you put your finger on the sensor, it will warm up and the matrix will become brighter as a result.

# Comments from Prof. Yoder
# Looks good.
