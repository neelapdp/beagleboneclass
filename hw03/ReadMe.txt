The etchsketch program is ready to go. The screen now displays on the 8x8 matrix
To run that program, type  python3 etchsketch.py 
 to get the screen to display and buttons to play with.


The temperature sensor reads correctly with the temperature. I showed both the temperature and matrix demos to Dr. Yoder. We couldn't figure out why the alert didn't work even when we set the bits on the device.

# Comments from Prof. Yoder
# Looks good.
