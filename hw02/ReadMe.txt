Dr. Yoder,

My program works with having four buttons that move up, down, left, right, and the diagnols
I just don't like the implementation. I had trouble with the pull up/down
buttons, and I think the MOD and PAU buttons might be pull up too.

In this code, I just continue to poll it. I don't think that I want to use 
callbacks on this one either. I like the phone idea that you had. I had bluetooth working on my old beaglebone black.
I want to try to look into that next. I will post more to my repo when I
get something working.
